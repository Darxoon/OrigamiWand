## Usage

Open the link above. To use this tool, you need a full dump of Paper Mario: The Origami King's RomFS, which can be obtained through various sources like NXDumptool or the Yuzu emulator.

If you want to open one of the game's files to modify them and place them back into the game, head to `File > Open` and select the file from there.

Once the file has been loaded, you can expand the objects and change their properties, which will affect how the objects behave. This program supports many file types, out of which many have sadly not been documented yet. In the meantime, see [this Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n5Y-fE2lAtEFBWkpXFYqbb6iKa4cqEIj2pGoXztAuRw/edit) for reference or ask on the discord (see below under "Contact").

To load the updated file into the game, go to File > Save, which will download the file into your Browser's Download Folder. Then place it in the correct place of the CFW's or Emulator's Mod folder.

## Features

* Place new NPCs, Items, Decoration and much more.
* Add new NPC Species, Items, Maps, etc.
* See how the game is structured internally (with descriptions)
