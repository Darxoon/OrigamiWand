## Usage

Open the link above. To open a file, first you need to decompress it. To do that, you can use [TOKElfTool](https://github.com/Darxoon/TOKElfTool) or KillzXGaming's [Switch Toolbox](https://github.com/KillzXGaming/Switch-Toolbox) (in future, Origami Wand will support this out of the box).

Open the decompressed files through File > Open. Once the file has been loaded, you can expand the objects and change their properties, which will affect how the objects behave. To load the updated file into the game, go to File > Save and compress the file with one of the programs listed above. Then place it in the correct place of the CFW's or Emulator's Mod folder.
